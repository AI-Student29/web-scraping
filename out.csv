"[<p><p>I bought my daughter a pair of Nike WinFlo9's in August of 2022. By November, they squeaked so bad when she would walk in them, the kids at school made fun of her.

Nike is associating itself with a company who's been reported for damaging and stealing the personal property of recipients.

He was on the court 3 times a week for a couple of hours each session, so around 108 hours total use. The left heel no longer holds air so we created a warranty claim.

"[<p><p>I was excited to purchase the new Nike Zoom for high intensity classes on January 12th. My plan was to join classes after my February Vacation.

I used to have all kinds of foot pain as a result of long hours standing hard concrete floors at work. The Air Monarchs stopped the pain within days. Too bad about the lousy glue. The price on these shoes was great ($50) and maybe I can “Shoe Goo” them once more to get another couple of months.

"I am very angry about this because we as consumers buy something, we should expect it to last. Especially the cost of these shoes.

Two days later, another email denying the claim again as normal wear &amp; tear. Come on now Nike... Please explain how having two different sized insoles is in any way normal? This could have been an easy, low cost fix. Instead, you have an upset mom &amp; customer who tried to do the right thing, the right way. Thank you for returning the shoes. They will now be thrown in the garbage as unusable.

"[<p><p>I have run with Nike shoes for decades. I wear them socially as well. Over the past few years, I have become hooked on Nike custom designs. Unfortunately, things have changed. Nike custom-designs no longer support a wide shoe. I wear a 9 wide. For the second time, I ordered a 10 medium because custom shoes are no longer available in wide. They don't fit. Furthermore, almost all of the noncustom shoes have a white sole. White soles were stylish about ten years ago--I had many pairs with white soles. Nike is known for being more fashion conscious than fit conscience (of course, performance depends on fit, unless one advertises differently), but it is time to go beyond white-only soles. I guess I will have to learn loyalty to a new company.</p></p>, <p>I have run with Nike shoes for decades. I wear them socially as well.

"[<p><p>I ordered 2 pairs of custom color Nike shoes (February 2019). The one that was absolutely unsatisfactory was ordered to have a red top alternately described by Nike as either Cherry Red or Crimson Red. Online and as printed from the site, the color looks like the Red as labeled to my naked eye. When the shoes arrived the color didn't match the color shown at all. Nowhere close. In fact, everyone who looks at the shoe and I ask what color it looks like to them has NOT mentioned Red once. Everyone every time (and I didn't prep or lead them by prefacing my question by mentioning they're supposed to be red) doesn't see Red. When I ask them what color they see the most frequent descriptions are Orange, Neon Orange, Hot Orange. The color is so far from red to be laughable.</p></p>, <p>I ordered 2 pairs of custom color Nike shoes (February 2019).

The first customer service person pushed back by saying that there are sometimes differences between how the/a color looks on the site, prints out on your printer and what it looks like in reality. His answer was immediate and I suspect that's because this has happened before. AND, if it has happened before, I would expect Nike to make the appropriate adjustment to its color dye or not present it falsely which is what they did in reality. I would expect them to adjust as needed so their advertised color matches reality; give that as much attention as they try to do with their engineering of the shoe in terms of its functionality - especially given the cost!</p>, <p>My second call got a bit more attention to my complaint, however, pretty much said the same thing - the colors sometimes don't come out how they look online (again, they obviously know that and they keep making this option available which they can't meet for whatever 'lame' reason). I sent them pictures of the shoes standing alone, the shoes next to other things red. They still didn't acknowledge what I think is their responsibility - people sell clothes, watches, etc., online and make sure that what you see is what you get.</p>, <p>Nike offered 3 things; return the shoes for a full refund, keep the shoes and get part of the price removed, keep the shoes and get promotional discount on my next purchase. I have kept the shoes and accepted the refund of part of my purchase price because I can still use them accepting that they aren't what they should be.</p>, <p>So, let the buyer beware if you're ordering custom colors. I wouldn't trust that what you see online is what you'll receive. And you shouldn't expect Nike to fully accept their terrible effort to customize according to your order. After many years as a runner who actually respects Nike's engineering (along with one of their competitors), I won't be buying their products any time soon. While it could be argued you're buying the shoe for how well it works as a running shoe so color shouldn't matter, it's my argument if Nike offers a custom colored shoe at the price they charge ($165.00), it should have the capacity to make it happen. They obviously don't. A terrible corporate response for an egregious mistake that Nike apparently is pretty comfortable continuing.</p>]"

"[<p><p>I bought Airmax 2015 sneakers 3 years ago and they're not holding up that well. It is pretty comfy and breathable, nice snug fit. Toe box is a little narrow so I had to go half a size up. I usually wear a 7.5, but for Nike I wear a size 8. I paid $180 when I bought it. The problem is, the quality of the shoe is not fair for the price. The right shoe's midsole got scratched or something, and now the air is leaking and it makes a squish sound when walking. The left shoe is fine though. I replaced the insoles with Dr. Scholl's athletic insoles, because they were slightly rough, it was uncomfortable when walking. The outsoles were less than average quality, plastic with barely enough traction. On wet areas, you can literally skate on asphalt and concrete lol. It was pretty fun, but I tripped a lot because of the slippery outsole. Fortunately, the later versions they have used some kind of rubber instead of plastic. Offers more traction and stability, albeit only moderately.</p></p>, <p>I bought Airmax 2015 sneakers 3 years ago and they're not holding up that well.

"[<p><p>Nike used to be the best. Apparently, they've gotten a little too big...because they are now the absolute worst company I've ever purchased from! If I could give them a less than zero rating, I would! Whether it's a representative, a supervisor, or a manager...NONE of them are the least bit concerned with helping their customers...or the overall experience their customers have.</p></p>, <p>Nike used to be the best.

Whether it's a representative, a supervisor, or a manager...NONE of them are the least bit concerned with helping their customers...or the overall experience their customers have.</p>, <p>I ordered two pairs of shoes on Nike's website before 9 AM EST yesterday (Wednesday, Aug. 29th) and chose next day shipping. Once the order was placed, the confirmation popped up on the website with my order number, a statement that a confirmation email had been sent to me, and a statement that the shoes would be received on or before today (Thursday, Aug. 30th).</p>, <p>After a couple of hours, I noticed that I had not yet received the confirmation email. I tried to search Nike's website for the status of my order (using the order # provided to me when I submitted the order). However, when I tried to search using my order # and email address, the order could not be found. I have now contacted Nike (via chat and phone) a total of at least six times about my order. The last chat I had yesterday was with a supervisor who assured me that my order was being processed and would be received today.</p>, <p>Around 2 AM this morning, Nike apparently sent me an email thanking me for my order. I clicked on the ""Order Status"" link in the email, and once I'm on the Nike site, I notice that the status of my order is still ""Preparing to Ship"". By the way, it still shows that status at 12:39 PM. I'm now on the phone with Nike Corporate. My call was dropped by the first person...and another agent picked up the call. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and this jerk tells me that it will probably take 2 hours to get a supervisor on the line. Seriously?? I guess he thought I would hang up, but I did not. Finally, after about 20 minutes, a supervisor picks up. Not very helpful...rather nonchalant...just like everyone else at Nike that I've spoken with so far.</p>, <p>She proceeds to tell me that my order is ""preparing for pick"" or some crap and that it could, in fact, be delivered today because the ""warehouse is not far away...just in Tennessee"". However, there is always a chance they may not be delivered today (although remember I chose next day shipping). AND it gets even better...now when I click on Order Status in Nike's email, the site no longer recognizes the order number...tells me it's invalid. NO ONE...not one person (including the two supervisors) I spoke with at Nike expressed any concern at all. They were either rude, nonchalant, arrogant or all of the above. The only ""solution"" they have provided to me is that I can send the shoes back with the prepaid shipping label once I receive them. Are you kidding me?!?!</p>, <p>From this day forward...I will no longer purchase Nike products. I plan on sharing this experience (which by the way isn't my first bad experience with Nike) online, via social media outlets, and by word of mouth. Nike needs to put every single employee through customer service training, refocus their efforts on treating their customers like they are the lifeblood of the company (because they are), and understand that they do have serious competition from other companies like Adidas, Under Armour, New Balance, and others...who actually DO know how to treat their customers!</p>]"

Customer service sent me the cleats with no explanation and everyone on the phone was not at all helpful. I was on the phone for an hour - corporate said Nike.com should help me and nike.com said corporate should help me - so I chatted online and was told – “too bad”.

However, in the last several years, they have all started falling apart. One pair started breaking up in tread on the bottom in bits like I was cutting it away with a knife.

For this reason, I have decided to buy New Balance made in the USA going forward. As one who has had Nike's shoes since the early 1980s as a kid, it's a shame they have taken profits first and outsourced all of their production to China with iffy quality. Brand recognition and loyalty mean nothing if the product falls apart prematurely. To put this Nike experience into perspective, I have two pairs of Cole Haan dress shoes dating from the 1990s and a combined five pairs of Timberland business-casual shoes and hiking boots that date from the early 2000s that are still good as new minus sole wear.

Then, if they do determine they are defective, Nike typically offers a $75 voucher which can be used to purchase merchandise on their very expensive website.

This most recent time, I let them know that I needed cleats immediately for my daughter, whose cleats broke in season. In a chat session, I expressed concern about paying for the cleats and then receiving store credit for the returned cleats after I already pair for the new cleats. The customer service rep told me they'd give us expedited shipping so she'd have the new cleats in time for her next soccer event and then I'd get a refund rather than store credit. Yet, when we got the refund, it was for two $75 vouchers. I contacted Nike and they said they didn't give me store credit, they gave me $150 worth of vouchers, which I'd used as payment for the returned defective cleats. </p>, <p>They indicated that store credit and vouchers were different, and pointed out that the rep said I wouldn't receive store credit. So they basically tricked me because the chat rep had my invoice and knew all along how I'd paid for the defective cleats that I returned. Basically, Nike was fine with my being out the $220 I'd spent on the new cleats to replace the returned defective cleats. </p>, <p>They assured me that the vouchers don't expire and I could use them on a future purchase. You can imagine how excited it made me that they have given me the opportunity to continue to buy their subpar products and deal with their passive aggressive customer service team that tonight kept making me repeat the details for an hour on chat before transferring me to a supervisor that then kept me on chat for another hour before denying my request but thanking me for my input which they valued because it helps with future customer experiences.

"On January 7th, I found the Nike Revolution 4 FlyEase running shoe. I again called Nike explained my situation and was again told I can order the two different sizes and return the ones I don't need for a refund. I got off the phone and joined Nike's membership so I could get free shipping. I then ordered the 2 pair of shoes at $60.00 a pair. I received the two pair of shoes and tried to initiate the return online, but kept running into ""an error has occurred."" I called Nike explained everything that happened and was told the return only can work if I purchased 2 pair of shoes that are 1 1/2 sizes and difference in width does not apply. I asked to talk with a supervisor, because even in Nike's notes about my previous conversations, they did not mention that. After being kept on hold, I was told the supervisor was too busy to talk to me."
"After another long wait I called again and nothing. Oh well they were issued and never cashed this time. So again another 3-6 months. Well it has turned into 3 years. And I just got off the phone with Nike and they just told me that they will no longer issue my vouchers or give my money back because it’s been too long and that they can’t find a record of one of my returns anymore!!! Really waiting 3 years and dealing with all this, they have the shoes I PAID FOR, PAID TO SHIP TO THEM, and have called wasted all this time dealing with them. And they are going to tell me, too much time has passed."
"I ordered two pairs of shoes on Nike's website before 9 AM EST yesterday (Wednesday, Aug. 29th) and chose next day shipping. Once the order was placed, the confirmation popped up on the website with my order number, a statement that a confirmation email had been sent to me, and a statement that the shoes would be received on or before today (Thursday, Aug. 30th)."
"After looking on here and seeing how many complaints it was and a lot of them similar to mine, I had to add this review because Nike is taking advantage of people like us and don’t even care! I really wish we could stand up to these big businesses that take our money and tell us to go away! They create rules and procedures to literally tell us to ** off, and if we don’t like it go buy shoes or whatever from someone else! This is not right and if there ever is any kind of way we can make Nike stop treating us consumers like crap, PLEASE count me in! I am so disappointed because I have been a Nike customer for over 30 years and this is the first time I had a problem where I asked for assistance and got a slap in the face!"
"Finally got told they had received them a week previously to this call. So I asked why hadn’t I been refunded, he never answered and just said he will process the refund now. Then he told me it could take up to 9 days to receive it in my bank. I asked why so long and was told that is the normal waiting period for every company. I questioned this and was told I must never use online services. Being disabled and almost housebound I tend to use online shopping for 90% of my purchases. This operator treated me like a fool. In all they were useless and I will never use this company ever again. I would not advise anyone to use them either. If you need to return an item you should take up a religion and start praying. This may be all that helps."
"I was able to successfully Shoe-Goo them based on instructions from a self-help home fix website, but it will remain to be seen if that will hold up (photo attached of an example while waiting to dry overnight). For this reason, I have decided to buy New Balance made in the USA going forward. As one who has had Nike's shoes since the early 1980s as a kid, it's a shame they have taken profits first and outsourced all of their production to China with iffy quality. Brand recognition and loyalty mean nothing if the product falls apart prematurely. To put this Nike experience into perspective, I have two pairs of Cole Haan dress shoes dating from the 1990s and a combined five pairs of Timberland business-casual shoes and hiking boots that date from the early 2000s that are still good as new minus sole wear. I got what I paid for there. Not so with Nike."
"""Unfortunately, after a thorough inspection of your product, we've determined that the issue is a result of outsole wear through to the internal airbag, which caused the airbag to deflate.

I didn’t want a refund. I just wanted an exchange for another Nonfaulty one because I actually really like the style of jacket. They said there is no more stock in store and can’t do anything about it. I was really surprised. Nike for sure still has it in their warehouse but was told they operate separate from Nike.com which I find ridiculous. I didn’t even end up taking the money since the offer was much less than the price I paid just a few weeks prior. I just want an exchange for a nondefective product. Simple request which I am surprised Nike can’t do.
"It is their way of getting dissatisfied customers to keep buying from them. This most recent time, I let them know that I needed cleats immediately for my daughter, whose cleats broke in season. In a chat session, I expressed concern about paying for the cleats and then receiving store credit for the returned cleats after I already pair for the new cleats. The customer service rep told me they'd give us expedited shipping so she'd have the new cleats in time for her next soccer event and then I'd get a refund rather than store credit. Yet, when we got the refund, it was for two $75 vouchers. I contacted Nike and they said they didn't give me store credit, they gave me $150 worth of vouchers, which I'd used as payment for the returned defective cleats. "
"I then checked online to see if they have a similar pair and lo and behold, the ones that was supposed to be out of stock is still in stock. I waited a week or so later and checked a few times and still in stock. What a crook and liar. Sending me a defective and used pair (which you can tell has been returned a few times) then lied.

I contacted customer service to see what the problem was, I was under the impression that the item was out of stock. I was then informed by the CSR, that there was an issue with my address, the apartment # wasn't listed &amp; that the order was en route to the warehouse, even though an unauthorized return was issued for 1 pair. The other 2 pair were somewhere. So, in the midst of all that, I checked my card saw that Nike had placed another authorization on my card causing an overdraft.</p>, <p>I stated to the CSR my concerns, she exchanged the 2 pair for the 1 that a return was being issued for because those are the ones I really wanted, I could have done without the other 2 pair but since those were discounted why not. I was also told that I would be credited the difference &amp; to expect it within 3-5 business days, but the credit is going against the overdraft charge of $36 that was initiated by Nike, in addition to the credit for the 1 pair that was in the process of being returned.

"[<p><p>I bought two pairs of the NIKE AIR PEGASUS Bowerman Series shoes some years ago. I wore one of them and decided to save the other unworn pair for later. One month ago, the sole of the pair I had lightly used began crumbling and separated from the shoe.

The sole of the UNWORN shoes was also beginning to come apart. (See 3 images, shoes have pink stripes)</p></p>, <p>I bought two pairs of the NIKE AIR PEGASUS Bowerman Series shoes some years ago.

The sole of the UNWORN shoes was also beginning to come apart. (See 3 images, shoes have pink stripes)</p>, <p>I called NIKE, and they told me to go to the nearest retail store. Last week I finally found time to drive there (the store is 40 miles away, in Raleigh there are no NIKE ""retail stores"" and now I see why.) I get to the manager and show him my shoes (the new-coming apart without being worn, and the ""used"" shoes), and ask him to do something about this. He tells me there is nothing he can do, that he has had people come into the store at the request of the ""NIKE customer service line"", and that basically, their shoes are designed to come apart regardless of use or not, in a couple years.</p>, <p>I insist that he do something about this, he declares that he can see that the shoes are UNWORN and that they are coming apart, but claims that ""all tennis shoe makers use this foam soles that disintegrate in two or three years no matter what"". I show him my Clark walking shoes and tell him that I wear and abuse them almost every day. He says that ""awww, Clarks are made differently..."" He goes ahead to tell me that the customer service people were wrong to send me over to a store, and that there are protocols for sending in shoes to ""review"" by some ""experts"" at NIKE, but that he thinks I will be turned down because he has had ""several"" cases of people trying to return or make a claim on shoes that have had soles coming apart, and that all claims were simply declined by this trashy company.</p>, <p>Nevertheless, he advises to send the shoes to them, and he assures me that I will receive a prepaid label that will cover postage to send the ""UNWORN NEW shoes with the soles coming apart"" to NIKE. I return home and fill out a form, I get a label, but no postage paid by NIKE. So... Really? Besides the $70+ I paid for the trashy shoes do I need to pay another $15 to get your defective shoes back to you, not expecting to get any positive response? What kind of a company does not stand behind their defective products?</p>, <p>I will not spend one more penny on ANY Nike product, nor will my family. I just heard they are laying off people, no wonder why. SHAME on you NIKE. I feel betrayed and angry. I will make sure everyone I know here's what happened and sees the pictures of the UNWORN shoes coming apart, because of a flaw, or worse: an intentional design that leads to the disintegration of the soles in a short period of time... this is deceivingly devious. What a way to make a buck! SHAME on this trashy company!!!</p>]"

I was told that because of the wear, they would not do anything about it. He is a BOY!!! They play rough, so make your products to withstand a little more activity. Whether it's on the court or outside playing. The amount of money you charge for these shoes and it got my son 3 months of use. No way will I be buying any more products from Nike. To top it off, I paid $20 to ship them to Nike for the inspection. They also tried to offer a discount on future purchases, thanks but no thanks.</p>]"

Regardless of age a shoe should not disintegrate. The upper of the shoe speaks to the use which is like new. They would do absolutely nothing.

Most other shoe companies would rather have a happy customer than one who feels cheated.
"Not me. I'm done with Nike, 100%. Tired of corps. like Nike cutting corners on quality. The material they use for sneakers now is PVC/Olefin, which is basically plastic. Maybe I'll make my sneakers out of old milk cartons now as they will probably last longer than Nike sneakers. I had a friend who worked for Nike in Korea. He said that they are always looking for material that is cheaper, lighter, and they couldn't care less about quality anymore. It's all about how many shoes they produce, and how quickly. Sorry, NIKE! You lost a customer here. I spent over 200.00 per year on sneakers with your company for the last 25 years. No MORE!"

My daughter is 21 years old and has been wearing sneakers her whole life. This has never happened to another pair... and these are only months old!!! See pics attached. Really? Two identical holes in each shoe in same exact spot where plastic broke through and cut her foot. This is normal wear? Shame on you NIKE! A huge disappointment.</p>]"

"[<p><p>Whenever I see Nike shoes in the mall, I can't help but be impressed at the aesthetics of their designs.

Usually, if a shoe is not designed for a certain type of movement, it will tear at its weakest point or at least, it will be deformed. My Nike Free so far is still in shape.

I've seen our national players used Nike during national tournaments, so I'd think Nike is comparable to brands like Yonex or Li-ning in terms of durability. There are a lot of shoes out there that are expensive but the quality is poor. Although Nike is a bit pricey, you won't regret buying one.</p>]"

"[<p><p>I bought a Premier soccer ball and after a few months of usage the glued panels were falling apart. I sent it to Nike at my expense and the decision was ""normal wear and tear"". I play soccer for almost 50 years and this is not normal by any stretch of the imagination. Shame on you Nike and look forward to spend my personal, family, and team money on products that take pride for their performance. You cheated me out of $50, but that is the last money you will ever see from me. What a shame of a global ""giant"". The ""supervisor"" checked the case but because I agreed to recycle I have no longer proof for my case. This will be a fascinating case to describe in all of my marketing classes.

They are sending me back my deflated shoes (through no fault of my own)!!!</p>, <p>I am so speechless right now. I can say this for sure. Being a lifelong customer of NIKE, I will actively do everything in my power to damage NIKE's reputation and actively persuade people not to buy NIKE, as I will never touch another NIKE product again. NIKE is the definition of a money hungry, low quality, overpriced, crooked corporation that does not care about its customer at all, nor does it stand behind its product whatsoever. THAT MUCH IS CLEAR PEOPLE. EXCUSE ME. I'M OFF TO RANT ON SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE NIKE IS.</p>]"
I have pictures to back up my claim but of course do not have the sneakers. A very sad day for me... I manufacture goods for consumers for living. We are a small company and cannot afford to take back goods if there are issues but we do because it's the right thing to do. My daughter is 21 years old and has been wearing sneakers her whole life. This has never happened to another pair... and these are only months old!!! See pics attached. Really? Two identical holes in each shoe in same exact spot where plastic broke through and cut her foot. This is normal wear? Shame on you NIKE! A huge disappointment.
"I'm really mad because $200 is a lot for a 21 year old to spend and Nike charges a crazy amount for their products. They are a terrible company to go to with a problem. I wish I could get ""Samantha"" back on the phone who told me they would be covered as well as the postage! The company is awful, we have many Nike products. They will not get another dime out of me. Here is the last response, I assure you nothing came in contact with the shoes. ""Thank you for contacting us regarding your product claim. Per you request I completed a review of the inspection, including a few photos the inspection team attached for reference. I can confirm the shoes do not have a material or workmanship flaw. Rather, the discoloration is the result of something the product came into contact with. Therefore, after careful consideration we stand by the Inspector's original findings and are unable to consider the product for compensation."""
"Its sole has an untraditional pattern but it has good traction. I never slipped once in any hardwood court I played in and I always moved well with it. While it gave great feet and ankle support it always feels like I'm not wearing it. No wonder LeBron still switched to it during the second half of his games even though at that time he just released the LeBron XI. The only downside to it is ventilation - my feet burn like hell after every game, so I remove my kicks once in a while when I'm on a break during games."
"My son has always worn Nike cleats because he has a narrow foot and really liked the feel of Nike shoes. We have never had an issue until the last 2 pair of cleats we have purchased. We also bought a pair of Nike Mercurial Superfly IV FG in June 2015 for $219 and they only lasted 5 months. The material started to fall apart and the shoe laces broke, but we went ahead and tried Nike again. I now regret that choice. We have spent $385 on Nike shoes in the last year. I didn't mind paying that much when I thought I was getting a quality shoe. It's really sad because I really expected Nike customer service to be better. We have been loyal Nike customers for 9 year, but we have now switched to another brand."
"I realize the front of the shoe takes the most impact when playing soccer but I would think they would be reinforced better in that area? Anyway, thinking twice of continuing to buy Nikes maybe time to try another brand. I did send them back to Nike with the receipt to show that they were relatively new shoes that this happened to - only to be told that they didn't find a defect and couldn't do anything about it."
"Also, the sole is non-marking and really sticks to the mat. I would not recommend it for badminton use but the fact it's still in shape says a lot about its durability and reliability. Nike had released a badminton shoe a few years back but I haven't tried it. I've seen our national players used Nike during national tournaments, so I'd think Nike is comparable to brands like Yonex or Li-ning in terms of durability. There are a lot of shoes out there that are expensive but the quality is poor. Although Nike is a bit pricey, you won't regret buying one."
"When Nike did respond, we were pleased that they gave us a gift card for the price of the shoes - which we fully expected as the store stated they have had many complaints about this mesh. HOWEVER, a multi-billion dollar company is too cheap to reimburse us for the postage. (Forget our time)? Are you kidding me? In the package, I included a letter that asked to be reimbursed for postage. NOTHING! I have spent THOUSANDS of $ on shoes for my kids...and this is how NIKE thanks us? LOSER."
"Well NIKE replied by saying ""Nike stands behind its products for both our retail accounts and consumers. Your product was inspected and found to be free of a material or manufacturing problem by an experienced Nike inspector and cannot be credited for replacement. All inspector decisions are final."" They are sending me back my deflated shoes (through no fault of my own)!!!"

When I replace my failed hissing shoes, I think I'm going to try another brand like UA. I have been loyal to Nike for 30 years but they will no longer sport a quality product and they don't seem interested in backing their bad products. So I will move on but wanted everyone to know what Nike will and won't support and their product failures and lower quality. They are no longer high quality.</p>]"

Nike has lost a valuable customer who pumps a lot of money out to them. I have 70 pair of shoes and 60 are Nike. Accountability of this flaw by Nike has been ignored while the customer loses.

At first, Nike tried to shut me off by saying once it left their warehouse the shipment is out of their control. They even told me I have to contact FedEx myself to reroute the package. Since I've been a heavy online shopper, I knew Nike was lying. I had many experiences with RalphLauren.com and Amazon.com etc. to solve rerouting packages issue even when it's not the mistake from their side. So I told the person answered the phone that I am not going to contact FedEx myself for I am not the shipper to have the right to reroute the package anywhere. I requested the customer services to escalate the issue to his supervisor, Jacob, and demand to reroute the package back to Nike. </p>, <p>The supervisor finally agreed after knowing no one will be there to receive the package and the package will be stolen for sure if sitting on my porch. I found that Nike.com's customer services are not helpful and they will try their best to push the trouble away from their hands even that means they have to lie. If it's not because I knew big company can definitely reroute the package, I may end up calling FedEx for nothing and package will be sitting on my porch before it got stolen.</p>, <p>On 12/20, I returned to United States and noticed that Nike has not refunded me. I contacted Nike again on 12/21 through their online chat. Nike acknowledged that package has been rerouted and I have never received the package. However, they also claimed it takes time to process refund and ask me to wait. While I requested a time frame waiting for refund, Nike's online chat replied and I quote, ""Sorry for the inconvenience Jessica, but we need more time for this. Rest assured, the refund will go back in your card as soon as possible"" and ""I know how you feel. Thank you for being a Nike+ member. We appreciate it"".</p>, <p>Of course I wasn't going to let their lousy customer services off the hook so easy so I kept demanding them give me a time or else I was waiting for nothing. So the customer services agreed to do ""extra mile"" for me. That was exact words the person used, extra mile for me. She told me she has escalated the issue and will make my account on ""high priority status"" and ""you will receive updates on your email from to time to time"" and she demanded I close the chatting browser, end of the case. I wasn't letting her go by asking her what is preventing Nike from refund my money and she finally typed ""Because UPS haven't returned the items to us yet"". </p>, <p>So what she has been telling me to wait and they will refund me as soon as possible is just BS?? In which part of the United States that takes more than a month to return a package? It's either they lost it or they didn't bother to update the return status. After I lost faith on Nike customer services, she finally said she would escalate to level 2 support! Nike's customer services will try their best to push your problem off then do their best to help you, period!</p>]"

"I SENT MY SHOES OFF TO GET LOOKED AT AND FIXED NOT FOR THEM TO TRY AND MESS THEM UP MORE JUST TO DENY MY CLAIM!!! I was so livid I called customer service and spoke to supervisor. They will have a second look!!! They said to take them to Foot Locker!!! ~ I don't even care about the stupid shoes ~~ But you didn't have to send me my shoes popped!!! Back to the point that I can no longer wear them!! You are thieves and liars!!! And I will do everything I can to stop anyone from buying from you ever again... Cheap shoes and on top of that, you stole from me my trust in you to inspect and send them back the way they were sent!!! Not in a worse condition!!! Nike needs to inspect their own inspectors!! Never buying from them ever again!!!"
"I even asked if Nike will not replace them can they help me fix them. The answer was no. I used to think Nike made high quality shoes and they once did. I have a pair from 1997 I still use today but their quality has gone downhill. Beware their shoes are not what they used to be. When I replace my failed hissing shoes, I think I'm going to try another brand like UA. I have been loyal to Nike for 30 years but they will no longer sport a quality product and they don't seem interested in backing their bad products. So I will move on but wanted everyone to know what Nike will and won't support and their product failures and lower quality. They are no longer high quality."
Also I never seen a perfect straight line scuff. This shoe was already rumored to scuff because of the last release of the All-star Chromeposite but I took a chance thinking Nike fixed the problem. I talked to Allison the Consumer Affairs supervisor and she wasnt any help. Basically I was screwed out of $300 that I worked hard for. Nike has lost a valuable customer who pumps a lot of money out to them. I have 70 pair of shoes and 60 are Nike. Accountability of this flaw by Nike has been ignored while the customer loses. The bus stops here and I'm getting off. They're in the process of returning my shoes to me so I don't have pics.
"Then several days later, I received a second pair. I called to see if they charged me twice or if the second pair was to say sorry for the terrible service. Nike.com told me they charged me only once. Then my credit card statement came with 2 charges. I have spoken now with customer service 6 times to straighten this out, spending hours of my time. After the charges appeared, the first customer service person hung up on me. The second spoke to a supervisor who told me there was only one charge and to have the first charge removed by the credit card company, since it was only a hold."
"At 3:30 pm I received yet another identical stock scripted email from Nike customer service (Phillip) and again said, yes, overnight as they are a gift. At approx. 4:30 pm I contacted Nike customer service via phone and, after being on hold for 20 mins was connected with supervisor Kourt. I again explained the background and urgency knowing at this point that my 13 yr old will not have her gift to open tomorrow for her birthday. They had 8 days to send it, I spoke with 5 different people and NO ONE took the time to make sure this was resolved in time to get the gift here despite repeatedly being told they had to arrive by 1/8. I am a heavy online shopper and have never experienced such incompetence."
"So I contacted Nike.com and told them it's their mistake for showing the delivery will be made on 11/21 but couldn't make it on time so I have to cancel it. At first, Nike tried to shut me off by saying once it left their warehouse the shipment is out of their control. They even told me I have to contact FedEx myself to reroute the package. Since I've been a heavy online shopper, I knew Nike was lying. I had many experiences with RalphLauren.com and Amazon.com etc. to solve rerouting packages issue even when it's not the mistake from their side. So I told the person answered the phone that I am not going to contact FedEx myself for I am not the shipper to have the right to reroute the package anywhere. I requested the customer services to escalate the issue to his supervisor, Jacob, and demand to reroute the package back to Nike. "
"We will NEVER buy another Nike product again. In the 40 years of playing soccer between my husband and son, we haven't once had a pair of soccer cleats fall apart like these Nike ones did.

The clerk apologized, saying it was their policy. I asked if they could look up the gift giver's name up on their system, but was told to do that they would need the credit card number. I asked to speak with a manager. Same result. At that point, I had no desire to exchange the items, and was told I would receive store credit without a receipt, but with a receipt, a credit would be processed to the original credit card.

"[<p><p>I have worn NIKES for many years and for the most part I have happy with the quality. A couple of months ago I bought a pair at a local sporting goods store. After wearing them for a few days I noticed that my right knee felt like it was being twisted for some reason. My knee did not bother me when I wore other shoes. One morning I put them on and noticed a noise coming from the right shoe leading me to believe that the shoe's air chamber had collapsed after only a few days of a 128lb person wearing them. I contacted the retailer and he refused to take them back since I had worn them. At that point I contacted NIKE and following their claim process sent the shoes to them at MY expense. A few weeks later I went on the website to check on the claim and I find out it has been denied and the shoes have been recycled. A couple of phone calls later they still refuse to credit me for the defective shoes. There were many mistakes made along the way and they refuse to admit it even though they are losing a lifelong customer.

I am utterly disappointed with their response. I paid such a high price for the shoes because its a brand name as well as considering my own comfortability. I think it would be better if I would have bought $30 shoes from Payless and then dispose them off after a while. Nike, the quality of the shoes and the management behavior, both are disappointing for me.

And can be punctured so easy and it's cost Rs 15000 rupee and has no repair option?? Nothing more to say. Make your own mind!!! Sorry for long explanation of my complaint.</p>]"

"When I called them and asked the question that if it's not my fault, its not company's fault; then whose fault is this? I mean if the shoes are not being misused and even then the bubble burst by just walking, then whose fault is this? Unfortunately they were unable to give me any satisfying answer. I am utterly disappointed with their response. I paid such a high price for the shoes because its a brand name as well as considering my own comfortability. I think it would be better if I would have bought $30 shoes from Payless and then dispose them off after a while. Nike, the quality of the shoes and the management behavior, both are disappointing for me. I am still unable to understand their attitude and the purpose of inspection, because if they did the inspection physically of the shoe, then why they told me to send the pictures?"
"Mr. Barkley may not understand that he is living a life with privileges that most ** cannot afford. I wonder if Mr. Barkley had a son that was killed by police using excessive force, would he not use his finances and fame to seek change in police excessive force. He maybe has forgotten where he came from and has little or no concern for those who still live in the environment that he has left behind. I hope that I’m not the only basketball fan that believes he is wrong and selfish in making these kinds of statements."
"Now, I could forgive a manufacturing error. However, if I pay over $100 for shoes, I expect them to last me longer than ten weeks. And HOW is a shoe that is falling apart at the seam ""normal wear and tear""?! What I cannot forgive is a company not valuing their customers enough to ensure a lasting product, and blaming me when said product falls apart? I am a full-time college student working part-time: $110 is not something I spend lightly. I am a repeat Nike customer, and have previously been very satisfied with their products and services. All of my running shoes are Nike, and have lasted me at least over a year. I like Nike products, but through this telling situation it’s been made clear to me that Nike does not value my loyalty at all, and does not back up their products well. Due to this, I will be buying my sportswear from competitors from now on, as will my entire family."
"[<p><p>From my high school and college days, I chose not to buy Nike due to the corporate nature of the company and their global effect on third world countries while selling them at the maximum profit. Of course being in an urban environment with a young boy now who asks to buy them I give in. I'm glad to read these posts to validate my original claim how the shoes are made poorly in third world countries, just like items in a dollar store yet because of the brand image we dismiss the fact we spent $100's of dollars. There is no quality to their products yet they continue to be in demand. My 10 yr old son has gone through four pairs of Nike shoes in one year. The cost being an average of $30/month just to wear Nike. Going through so many pairs, one Nike Free only lasting 2 months, was a good way for him to see how cheaply made they were. It's impossible now to socially consciously buy any shoe but Nike has no quality in their shoe products.</p></p>, <p>From my high school and college days, I chose not to buy Nike due to the corporate nature of the company and their global effect on third world countries while selling them at the maximum profit.

I have essentially been waiting to purchase the limited edition Nike Fuelband SE Metaluxe in Gold (what a mouthful I know). It was released in America on June 5th, 2014 and I completely understand that the dynamics in general of Nike Canada run differently than Nike U.S. in terms of release dates, and the demands of each individual store, even their website (Don't get me started on the fact that as a Canadian Nike Consumer I am unable to order product online from either the US or Canadian site). </p></p>, <p>I'm going to have to agree with @sdvsdfb, although I have yet to purchase my product, Nike Customer Support Canada limited in actually providing useful support.

Fine, but being the proactive person that I am I wrote an email to Nike Customer Support asking for possible info on a particular Canadian release date. I received an email stating that the gold fuel bands were at the store but she could not see the stores stock. In case they were sold out I could place an order via the phone through that store. I found it odd but I just figured maybe the product was in such high demand that they sold out within a day of my calling the store.</p>, <p>The following day I called this particular store and asked if they had anymore of said product, upon receiving the answer no, I asked if I could place an order. I was then told by the manager I could not place an order for an item that the store has never had. Absolutely puzzled I emailed Nike customer support again to clear up this confusion. The response was short. My system says they received a shipment and they must have sold out. At this point my level of confusion was at an epic level. Here I have the store manager telling me they have not received this product at all and are completely unaware of it arrival or if they will even be getting this item. The customer support on the other hand who should have, as far as I am concerned, up to date/correct information about shipments at least telling me they have received said item and they must have sold out. I took it a step further and called customer support thinking perhaps they would give me more accurate information and I could maybe explain the situation better directly speaking to someone. I was wrong of course. </p>, <p>When I called, I explained the situation and the varying answers I was receiving. This time the representative informed me of a specific date as to the arrival of the gold fuel bands. January 19th 2014!!!?? But wait, how is it possible for an item that was released on June 5th 2014 in the US to show up almost 5 months before its release date. He then went on to say that is the last date a shipment was made for the Gold SE. Keep in mind, there is also a Rose Gold and Silver SE that were released prior to the Current Gold. Then I was told they could not see the stores stock so it could be sold out.</p>, <p>At this point I feel as though the Nike store employees are lying to me because I expect customer service to have the most current and up to date information regarding product. Not to mention the stores manager had a bit of attitude (in part I assume from having many people call regarding this product) so I figured maybe she just wanted me to stop calling or was hoarding product for her list of preferred customers or something. I call the store again, explained the varying differences in what I was being told by their store vs customer support. Annoyed by having to deal with my persistence she told me that customer support could not provide me with info regarding the stores stock and that again she could not give me info regarding arrival and she herself as manager only knew of stock on its actual arrival date. I made one last attempt to contact customer support. I outlined the fact again that it is impossible for them to have received a shipment of Gold SE in January as it was released in June and the varying degrees of confusion created that resulted in not being able to get a uniform answer, shoot an answer period to my question. </p>, <p>It was reiterated that the system says January 19th (which I believe is actually the date of the rose gold shipments but their systems has it read as gold). Furthermore, there was no more information in the system that could answer my question. I asked if there was another avenue be it number or email, even an address where I could direct my question and I was bluntly told no. I assume based on this situation (as well as the not being able to order product online to Canada) that Nike sees Canada as a second tire market and does not really care about customer relations over here as their support team is lax, or ill equipped to answer certain questions and seemingly impolite. The fact that I am literally doing all this work to give them my money is amazing to me. As a consumer I would have expected more especially from such a large company. Side note I accidentally called the American Nike support line prior to calling the Canadian line. The individual I spoke with was extremely friendly, informative despite being unable to answer my question (only because his system obviously could not access Nike Canada's information). </p>, <p>The next day I received an email asking about my experience with said support representative. Not once have I been asked to comment regarding my multiple contact with Customer support in Canada further cementing my opinion about Nike Canada. As a brand/company as large as Nike you would think things would be different. Maybe Canadian money is not a big incentive to this company as service here is drastically different than in America. With that being said, I'm sure Nike could care less about me and my opinion, my measly $150 and satisfaction are minuscule in the grand scheme of things for them at least.</p>]"

"I called the only store in Ontario that would carry the product of my desire and was told they have not received said item and have no clue as to when they would be receiving it. Fine, but being the proactive person that I am I wrote an email to Nike Customer Support asking for possible info on a particular Canadian release date. I received an email stating that the gold fuel bands were at the store but she could not see the stores stock. In case they were sold out I could place an order via the phone through that store. I found it odd but I just figured maybe the product was in such high demand that they sold out within a day of my calling the store."
"Point, my competitor isn't a minority and has the account and corporate stores such as Dick's Sporting does too. I have top brands in sports accessories and I have accounts with many brands but I was told I don't suit Nike's distribution plan. There isn't a distribution plan in my mall and area at all. I'm doing this not anymore for me but for the many future minority owned sports businesses that will want to carry the Nike product. I feel Nike wants minority owned businesses to sell their shoes in urban areas but not their jerseys that sell more in suburb areas. This is needed to be told."

I don't like to do business with a company that lacks good customer service."

I am returning my Nike today and never wear it again. I would rate this product a 0 out of 10. But unfortunately, I like Reebok more than Nike. Sorry, it's very difficult when it comes to shoes.

"[<p><p>After sitting on a shelf for a number of years, I recently placed a pair of unworn Nike shoes into service for the first time. 4 hours into their trial run, the sole completely separated from the uppers. The foam sole tore down the middle from heel to arch and began flapping. Under further inspection, the front sole had begun peeling away as well. Feeling it to be obvious, the shoes had no wear and that in anyone's estimation there was some sort of defect. I filled out the online form and shipped the shoes to Nike for their input. Admittedly, as these shoes were older, I expected little in the way of remuneration but did anticipate some type of explanation.

I also asked why they would not investigate for their own benefit but only received the repeating loop of their 2-year policy (might as well been talking to a recording). I've been a Nike supporter for over 25 years but figure they have gotten enough of my money, and now time. Guess we will see how well Adidas stands behind their product.</p>]"

I mailed the shoes to Nike along with receipt copy and a letter letting them know the history. Nike emailed me that these shoes only show ""normal"" wear.

Their answer was that if I don't use the voucher and get something from Nike.com, then it would be useless. I requested for them to send me a new pair and take the voucher back - they said no. I asked for the rest of the money that was owed to me and they said no.

I actually called for further explanation and was told that their shoes were meant to be worn, and sitting on a shelf, the adhesive could fail and shoes deteriorate. I've had shoes last longer under constant wear without falling apart. Wear out, yes; fall apart, no. I also asked why they would not investigate for their own benefit but only received the repeating loop of their 2-year policy (might as well been talking to a recording). I've been a Nike supporter for over 25 years but figure they have gotten enough of my money, and now time. Guess we will see how well Adidas stands behind their product."
I'm not happy about the service I received and would not recommend Nike to any of my friends or family in the future. I am extremely disappointed that the rep did not speak to me about this chip and now I don't have a receipt for this transaction. I'm not able to inquire about this product as I don't have any proof. I'm not happy!
"I will never buy Nike and the only reason I sell it is because I have to! Shame on you Nike, but I'm sure you don't even care."
"Here's the issue, Nike.com does not sell these or any other boxing shoes on their website. To make it worse, they did not refund the entire amount I paid for the shoes. I simply wanted a new pair; I did not want any money back. I called customer service and told them my story. Their answer was that if I don't use the voucher and get something from Nike.com, then it would be useless. I requested for them to send me a new pair and take the voucher back - they said no. I asked for the rest of the money that was owed to me and they said no. Now, I'm forced to get something from Nike.com just so I won't lose the voucher's $75.00 and I'm forced to buy a new pair of boxing shoes from another location. "
"We were told by a sales clerk that they were out, so we asked a manager and she told us that it was only while supplies lasted. Why was this not posted and what was the real answer - we still do not know. We are not asking for anything for free but we feel we are losing out on our next visit to one of our favorite stores. Looking forward to your response - an avid but disappointed Nike customer."

"[<p><p>My fiance purchased for me a pair of Nike Air Max sneakers (size 7Y, purple/grey). I had owned a pair the year before and they were great. It lasted the whole year, which included a pregnancy weight gain and a lot of walking at work.

I’m no longer pregnant, 50 lbs. lighter, and doing the same amount of walking at work that I did the previous year. I couldn't believe what happened. The sole underneath wore way too quickly. Then one day as I was walking down the hallway at work, the left sneaker sole that was filled with air (hence, the name Air Max) popped without warning and deflated. I nearly lost my balance and fell on my face. Shocked and very disappointed, I contacted my fiancé but he couldn't find the receipt. So I decided to contact Nike Corporate directly.

Normal wear and tear? Excessive use? What? I contacted them again and asked if they had taken the time frame of three months into account. They said that it was noted, but that their decision is final. I use the sneakers mostly for work. ""I only walk,” I said, “I don't run or jog or exercise in them."" I was still told that their decision is final. Even if I walked in my sleep, excessive use for only three months should not damage a product so expensive as to render it completely useless. </p>, <p>My fiancé says he paid $169.00 for my gift. Now he is out $169.00 and I am out of a good pair of sneakers for work.

They told me I live on a military base when I am positive I live in a normal neighborhood with no military base in my town. I asked for the manager who apparently was in Iowa and his name was Joshua. As I talked to the manager, he told me he could not change or cancel the order (when I placed it only 5 minutes before). He also continued to tell me I clicked ""military shipping"" on their website. Not only did I not ""click"" on military shipping, but there is not even a ""military shipping"" option on the Nike website! Once he informed me there was nothing he could do, I asked him where my son's soccer cleats would be sitting for 30-40 days before they ship to us. He did not know. We will be calling again tomorrow to see if anyone else can help. </p></p>, <p>I purchased $250.00 Nike T90 IV today for my son (online), and after I bought them, it said shipping would be 30-45 days.

"I filed a claim and sent them back the product to take a look. After about two weeks, I received the sneakers back in the mail with a letter stating that they cannot refund or exchange the product because it was due to normal wear and tear damage or excessive use. Normal wear and tear? Excessive use? What? I contacted them again and asked if they had taken the time frame of three months into account. They said that it was noted, but that their decision is final. I use the sneakers mostly for work. ""I only walk,” I said, “I don't run or jog or exercise in them."" I was still told that their decision is final. Even if I walked in my sleep, excessive use for only three months should not damage a product so expensive as to render it completely useless. "
"Frankly speaking, I do not accept such problems and in such short period time from such a brand company called Nike. After speaking with staff, I found that this ball is not of any use to me. I did not accept this, after spending so much money on brand name, Nike. I would request you to look upon my problem and help me to solve this problem. I am also attaching the bill and photos of the football. I would Accept a positive answer from you and your staff. Thank you."

"[<p><p>They cheated me out of KD IV's: I went into the Nike outlet factory today at Discover Mills in Lawrenceville, GA.

He told me he can’t do anything, but take ten percent off the $66, not the full price.

"The store I purchased them from stated they had a few complaints regarding the same shoes. This is the last Nike I will purchase for my family. I plan on letting every person I can, not to purchase Nike shoes and that the company does not stand behind their products."
"I told them they already told me that I would pay $30 from the first associate, and he said, “I’m sorry, but it’s not the price.” I complained about how they have to honor their pricing when they told me it was for $30. The manager came out, and to my dismay, he was even less understanding and looked at me with a disrespecting look. He told me he can’t do anything, but take ten percent off the $66, not the full price. It really felt like they weren’t trying to sell me this shoe on purpose, as all they were doing was talking about the shoe and how they meant to shelve it somewhere no one could find it."
"All I want is a wearable pair of shoes of equal value. They are of no help at all, and will not even reimburse my postage unless their experts determine that there is a manufacturer's defect. So, basically, I have no warranties at all. I have worthless shoes that I spent hard earned money for. I am extremely dissatisfied!"
"I don't know if you are using cheaper fabrics to save money, but I am a long-time shoes buyer. I never thought I would have an issue like this. I don't know what the steps are in sending them back to you, so that you are able to see the damage on these sneakers. It's crazy. I'm not rich, but I do like to have the best for my self and sons. So please would you send me a address to return or something?"
"Again let me emphasize how dissatisfied I am with the construction of the shoe, perhaps if they were made in the United States the quality would be better. Since I purchased these three months ago I no longer have a bill of sale only my word that I spent in the $60 to $70 range. I would expect some type of compensation to either have them replaced or repaired."
"I then stated I would have to wait till I could afford another pair probably not till income tax. She told me that would be fine and that they would still be under warranty. I ended up having some extra money I saved up to get me another pair of shoes (shox) till I could get my other ones replaced considering they would have them anywhere from 7 to 21 business days. I sent them out about a week ago. I checked the status of my claim today on the internet. Denied. Well, I would like to know what they consider a defect because those were the worst pair of shoes ever! The quality was nothing like I've had in the past. The only problem I have had in the past with the shox is the top of the shoe where it attaches always comes loose but nothing a little gorilla glue can’t fix. I'm really disappointed in Nike and I guess in their quality and warranty, too!"
"Nike does not cover their shoes from manufacturing or fabric defect, that is a rip off. Cannot believe that a company like Nike does not stand behind their products. Maybe because the shoe was made in Thailand. I posted a video on YouTube. Nike shame on you."
"I don't believe the tennis, running, or hiking shoes are even as good as many of the competitors. I threw away my last pair today, & the problem on every pair of Nike I've thrown away has been the glue and/or foam between the sole & the uppers of the shoes. I haven't had this happened with other brands, but on Nike the glue gives way after a few years of normal (not everyday) use & well before the shoes are worn or ready to be thrown away."

The bubble popped and the sole on one of the Nike' started to come off.  I've been wearing Nike since age two and even my kids wear them.  This is the first time I ever had trouble with Nike sneakers and this may be the last time I'll buy them anyway.</p></p>, <p>I paid $176 for my Nike Trainer TR1 men's sneakers size 12.

"[<p><p>I am extremely disappointed! A three-month old Nike Cortez's soles was unglued. I wonder if this is the effect of higher manufacturing cost and cheap labor.

"[<p><p>I bought my Nike full length air shoes from the Nike shoe store at Plaza De Americas in San Ysidro over a year ago.  When I bought them, they did squeak but I thought it was because they just needed to be broken in.  Well, they still squeak and people can hear me coming a mile away so I would like them to be replaced accordingly.</p></p>, <p>I bought my Nike full length air shoes from the Nike shoe store at Plaza De Americas in San Ysidro over a year ago.

"[<p><p>I have a pair of black walking shoes made from Nike but the heels on the shoes keep on squeaking.  These shoes were not squeaking when I first bought them.  I work in a hospital and it has become very annoying.  It sounds like I'm walking with a wet pair of shoes.  I have a co-worker who has the same pair of shoes and his does the same thing.  These shoes are only two months old.  I can't find my receipt and I'm very disappointed with this shoe.  I would like a new pair of shoes that don't squeak.  Thank you.</p></p>, <p>I have a pair of black walking shoes made from Nike but the heels on the shoes keep on squeaking.  These shoes were not squeaking when I first bought them.

"I've bought several pairs of Nike Shox over years and still have many in new condition.  They are not worn daily or for work either. In all the years I have never experienced anything like now. The whole Shox part on the bottom of the right shoe has detached, making the shoe unable to wear anymore. I would like something to be done to resolve this issue so I can feel comfortable buying Nike in the near furture."
I play basketball at a moderate level and I need a good pair of basketball shoes to last me longer than these ones did. The production date on the shoes is 11/11/10. I have only worn these shoes for one season and they are almost completely useless. I am extremely upset that these shoes did not hold up as long as I thought they would because they were a fantastic pair of shoes as they lasted. 
"I came home and went online to find my daughter some basketball shoes and I was amazed that Nike only offered one style of basketball shoes for girls. I also noticed you can filter a search by sport and the girls and women sports were running, tennis, soccer but no basketball. The men and boys not only have pages of basketball shoes to pick from but also have athletes (only men basketball players) lines to choose from as well. I am shocked and appalled that Nike does not offer more styles to girls and women that play basketball. "
I originally wanted to purchase Nike Air TN's which I have always bought since they first came out but they don't have a great selection in Ireland. So I thought I would try these out and have always preferred Nike brands to any other since I was a small child. I don't know what to do but this has made me reluctant buying Nike trainers now.
